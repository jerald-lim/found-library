## introduction
inscribing a thing into the realm of the digital can feel like a further abstraction and diversion from its *real* 'nature' or 'essence' or 'spirit', but perhaps this mode of representation allows us to break free in some ways from the limitations of other modes such as photography, oral retellings, and embodied sensemaking.

it is not possible to merely reflect without injecting new meaning, and adding more appendages by which we might not comprehend or master, but rather enter into deeper relation with the represented. this nonlinear nodal networked form gives us the opportunity to forefront the normally foreclosed boundaries between things in, but also of and around, our found library.

## prompt; what is a node?
our present task is to create 7 nodes a week each, each week, until and perhaps throughout our final exhibition at starch (~200 nodes total at opening). a node is not a representation of a single object, but something that [1] embodies one of its qualities, observed, imagined, and/or bestowed, [2] describes a contextual clue tied to its time, place, and/or ancestry, [3] expresses something with and/or about it, whether myth, memory, and/or inspired. nodes can represent one, or multiple things from the library.

## guidelines
each node can be as short as long as you'd like, and be expected to grow and change over time. so please find it in you to start 7 entries, even if they are short ones, in between our weekly meetings. if it makes sense for you to add to a node instead of making a new one do what you gotta do, but ideally you still add 7 nodes total each week even if it's just a single line so we can grow the density of the network and enrichen connections.

if a node you wish to create already exists, please look at it and decide if you should instead add to it or adjust the name of your node (or check with the rest about the existing node name) if there is significant divergence.

### technical details
1. **always** use the command `Create backup` before editing to make sure you are working off the latest version of our network
	1. this is the equivalent of 'saving the shared doc' for all of us, so run it as much as possible (after making a node / change)
	2. if your node isn't showing up on the site, make sure it's in the publish folder
2. type `---` when starting a new document to open up the properties panel
	1. you should input the following variables where possible
		1. `dateCreated` if this is a new node
		2. `dateUpdate01` if this is the first update
			1. `dateUpdateXX` for each subsequent update
		3. `tags` 3-5 tags that are conceptually/abstractly related to the node
		4. `title` if the page title needs to be different from the file name (for example if you want the node to appear with a / a character that cannot be part of the file name)
			1. if there is no title variable, the file name will be the page name
		5. `excerpt` this is the text that will appear 
3. use `[[ ]]` double square brackets to link to other nodes - try to make as many links as possible
	1. you can also 'pre'-create links/nodes and click through to fill them in (now or later); if the pages are created later the links will activate
4. use `#`, `##`, etc. for level headings as needed
5. you should be able to paste images (and other files) directly into nodes as well
	1. check to make sure the files are present in the attachment folder
