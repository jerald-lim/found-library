"Join us for a walk with, where we navigate a path from I_S_L_A_N_D_S to the time ball at [[fortCanning]], with items on loan from our Found Library, and the rich knowledge embodied in each being. As we walk, we will hold, feel, play, and exchange, fostering a deeper connection with objects and each other. Join us in weaving together our (his)stories, sparking imaginative dialogues and nurturing a shared sense of ecological consciousness.
