as i step off of bus 124 my eyes reflexively scan the curb. in the crack i see a bright yellow shape, immediately recognisable as a rubber duck. i wait for the bus to leave before i bend down to pick it up.

it reminds me of the traffic cones i see all the time around here, oddly bright and with a surface that lies somewhere between hard and soft. though in contrast to those objects which can command space and can tell cars to "back off!", this little yellow rubber duck has no gravitas, as evidenced by the tire marks that cover its body. 

i try to scrub the scuff off when i get to the studio, but to no avail.
