floating necessitates that two things come into immediate relation and contact with one another. in our case, the dirty, voiceless, rubber duck, phylliam, came in contact with water. we found that although it could not do it "upright" (whatever that means for a rubber shape without sensory organs), the duck floats.

it's funny that in contrast, when we put ice cream on top of root beer, we call it a root beer float, as if the liquid were the floating body. if we insist on the separation of the two objects, it would be more consistent to call it floating ice cream on top of root beer.

i'm sensing the flaws in this argument, and realise that actually liquid is not an object per-se. but then neither is the duck, for that matter... so what is floating about really?
