In July 2024 Found Library was at *I_S_L_A_N_D_S* and the librarians were getting worried that the objects were feeling cooped up. After all, many of these folks had never been in such a small space. 

So we devised a plan and put this on the Found Library social media:

"Join us for a walk with, where we navigate a path from I_S_L_A_N_D_S to the time ball at [[fortCanning]], with items on loan from our Found Library, and the rich knowledge embodied in each being. As we walk, we will hold, feel, play, and exchange, fostering a deeper connection with objects and each other. Join us in weaving together our (his)stories, sparking imaginative dialogues and nurturing a shared sense of ecological consciousness.
