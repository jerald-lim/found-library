according to the cambridge dictionary: 

duck *noun* (BIRD)
a bird that lives by water and has webbed feet (= feet with skin between the toes), a short neck, and a large beak:
- *the ducks started quacking loudly when we threw them some bread.*
- *a duck pond*

the meat of this bird:
- we had roast duck

but the duck in question is neither of these 🐥

maybe it is this third one:

duck *noun* (PERSON)
a friendly way of talking to someone you like:
- [as a form of address] *Come and sit beside me, duck.*
