"what a thin rectangle! shiny and with perfect rounded corners..." 

i stoop up to pick it, then palm it around in my sweaty hands.

looks rusty... or is it aged glue? 

probably the latter. even though it's metal and they must have used extra heavy duty super glue, in the end the metal rectangle has ended up just like my fancy shoes i save for special occasions: soles detached from the body, thanks to whatever strange organism that silently devours glue in this tropical climate.
