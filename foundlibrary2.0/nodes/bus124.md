this route goes along alexandra road, connecting nice places like your house, alexandra village food center, casual poet's library, master prata, ikea (if that's your jam),  queensway shopping center (where queensway television lives), gillman barracks, and labrador park. 

a nice bus route. but if you miss it you'll have to wait and wait and wait and wait. next thing you know, your short commute has become a long one. then you think, "maybe i should have biked."

although if you biked, you would not have met the duck.
