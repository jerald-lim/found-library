this route goes along alexandra road, connecting nice places like home, alexandra village food center, casual poet's library, master prata, queensway shopping center (where queensway television lives), gillman barracks, and labrador park. 

a nice bus route. but if i miss the bus i'll have to wait and wait and wait and wait. next thing i know, my short commute has become long. then i think, "maybe i should have biked."

although if I biked, I would not have met the duck.
