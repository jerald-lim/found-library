Supassara Ho is a practising artist from Thailand with a background in comic illustration and digital art. She currently develops narratives through her practice in crochet, with works that often focus on craft beyond its utility and functionality. Through her practice, Supassara spotlights the processes associated with craft as a means to carve time out despite situations within fast paced environments; while also questioning the idea of “craft” in the context of traditional craft and fine arts.

Notably, Supassara has exhibited works for the Critical Craft Collective Lab that was held during SAW 2024, Supper House’s “a light flashes and a box drops from the sky” and “Lunar”, and participated in numerous other exhibitions held in institutions like LASALLE College of the  Arts and Alliance Francaise de Singapour.
