ahh the everlasting yet unplaceable smell of the strata mall; guitar shop galore

when we were setting up islands (to link) the guitar shop neighboring us lent us their ladder so we would put up the signage for our space

kenta and i have come to the opposite end of the mall to jam for cheap in a non-soundproof studio too

never change
