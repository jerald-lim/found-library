I saw the rock at the Found Library. I felt a connection with the rock. I took the rock home. I intended to take the rock to different places and take polaroids of it. But the rock was too cozy at home, and so was I. So I left the rock to peacefully exist at home. Then I gave the rock a friendship bracelet to wear. The bracelet was made of LED filament and cables. The rock wore the friendship bracelet for the exhibition opening and throughout the exhibition. I was going to return the rock. But asked if I could keep it. The rock is still with me today, though it's no longer wearing the friendship bracelet. It knows we are friends even without it. It's a studio rock now.
