Siew Guang Hong (b. 2000) is a multidisciplinary artist primarily working with ceramics and sculpture. His practice revolves around exploring gender and sexuality. Placing special importance on sociology and beauty, Siew develops pieces centering around his study of the abject and the uncanny. To him, these fringes in aesthetics bear important connections to the marginalised queer experience in Singapore. Siew is under the TIF-SOTA Scholarship and was a previous recipient of the David Marshall Scholarship. His works have been showcased in Pulse Gallery Bangkok (2022), Another Impossibility (2022)@SOTA Gallery, TIF Virtual Emerald Auction (2021), and The Unforgetting Space (2017)@TheatreWorks.
