Victoria Hertel Velasco is a Singapore-based artist with German-Venezuelan roots. Her work uses sensorics to explore the connections between technology, spirituality, and ecology, as a way of rethinking how human activities interact and co-exist with diverse aspects of our environmentâ€”from other organisms and botanicals to data transfer and atmospheric conditions. Her artistic practice also serves as a research platform for material repurposing, experimental microcontrolling and biophilic design. When she is not in the studio, she enjoys hunting for vintage vinyl, reading random non-fiction, tasting coffee roasts, and discovering soothing aromas to expand her sensory palette.
